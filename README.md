# Substrate Node

### Rust Setup

First, complete the [basic Rust setup instructions](./docs/rust-setup.md).

### Run

Use Rust's native `cargo` command to build and launch the template node:

```sh
cargo run --release -- --dev --tmp
```

### Build

The `cargo run` command will perform an initial build. Use the following command to build the node
without launching it:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

### Embedded Docs

Once the project has been built, the following command can be used to explore all parameters and
subcommands:

```sh
./target/release/node-template -h
```

## Run

The provided `cargo run` command will launch a temporary node and its state will be discarded after
you terminate the process. After the project has been built, there are other ways to launch the
node.

### Single-Node Development Chain

This command will start the single-node development chain with persistent state:

```bash
./target/release/node-template --dev
```

Purge the development chain's state:

```bash
./target/release/node-template purge-chain --dev
```

Start the development chain with detailed logging:

```bash
RUST_LOG=debug RUST_BACKTRACE=1 ./target/release/node-template -lruntime=debug --dev
```

### Connect with Polkadot-JS Apps Front-end

Once the node template is running locally, you can connect it with **Polkadot-JS Apps** front-end
to interact with your chain. [Click here](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer?rpc=ws://localhost:9944) connecting the Apps to your local node template.

### Multi-Node Local Testnet

If you want to see the multi-node consensus algorithm in action, refer to
[our Start a Private Network tutorial](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/tutorials/start-a-private-network/).

### Node

A blockchain node is an application that allows users to participate in a blockchain network.
Substrate-based blockchain nodes expose a number of capabilities:

-   Networking: Substrate nodes use the [`libp2p`](https://libp2p.io/) networking stack to allow the
    nodes in the network to communicate with one another.
-   Consensus: Blockchains must have a way to come to
    [consensus](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/advanced/consensus) on the state of the
    network. Substrate makes it possible to supply custom consensus engines and also ships with
    several consensus mechanisms that have been built on top of
    [Web3 Foundation research](https://research.web3.foundation/en/latest/polkadot/NPoS/index.html).
-   RPC Server: A remote procedure call (RPC) server is used to interact with Substrate nodes.
